# Quiz 2: my classy robot children

Starter pack for EECS 1720 Quiz 2. Probably you should start by reading this first...

## Initialize

So. Your repo should look like this. Pay attention!!!

1. To the location (`robots-make-art-too/firstname_lastname`)
2. To the structure (`you'll want to put this Quiz 2 folder into your _Quizzes_ folder`)

See this image for reference:

## Contents

In your `Quiz 2` package you have the following directories, where `root` is `Quiz_2-where-my-classy-children-at`:

- root/------------------| README.md, STATEMENT.md
- root/Code/------------| general container
- root/Code/p5jsQ2/----| `p5js` content
- root/Code/pydeQ2/---| `python`-mode content
- root/Code/references/-| functions and content to use

So, as you can imagine, `p5jsQ2/` will contain template `JavaScript` where you will add _some_ `p5js`, and `pydeQ2/` will contain template `python` where you will add _more than some_ `python`.

Any `p5js` libraries are provided, and you _should_ already have any processing `python` mode libraries installed _from before_ (otherwise you should probably install them now).
